        <h3>Bus Game Rules &#x1F68C;</h3>
        <p>The game begins with a shuffled standard 52-card deck. The player must advance through four stages. <br> In each stage, a prediction is made, and a card is revealed from the top of the deck to determine the outcome.</p>

            <h4>1. Red or Black</h4>
            <p>The player predicts the color (Red or Black) of the next card. The card is drawn and revealed. <br> If the guess matches the card's color, the game proceeds.</p>

            <h4>2. Higher or Lower</h4>
            <p>Based on the first card revealed, the player predicts if the second card will have a higher or lower value. <br> The second card is drawn and compared to the first.</p>
       
            <h4>3. Between or Outside</h4>
            <p>The values of the first two cards create a numeric range. <br> The player predicts if the third card will fall strictly inside or outside these two numbers. <br> The third card is drawn and revealed.</p>
    
            <h4>4. Guess the Suit</h4>
            <p>For the final card, the player must predict the specific suit (Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, or Spades). <br> The fourth card is drawn to verify the prediction.</p>
        <br>
            <h4>i. Deck Reset</h4>
            <p>Cards are dealt continuously from the deck. <br> If the deck is exhausted during gameplay, it is automatically reshuffled to continue the game.</p>
            
            <h4>ii. Counter</h4>
            <p>The counter placed at the bottom of the table displays how many times the player guessed wrong.<br>If that number exceeds 20 tries, a visual effect appears on the screen representing the tiredness of the player. Drink up!</p>
